Final Project 

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I would interpret user needs by the want of the user. Listening to the customer and seeing what the end user experiences. The ultimate goal is a satisfied customer. The product owner creates user stories to help display what the customers are looking for. They are specific guidlines that the customers are looking for in the end product. By the product owner using clear concise writing the developers and testers are able to use these guidelines to create a product for the end user.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
There are many different types of languages for program developments, I have found it will take some good time and practice to be good. Starting with the basics and displaying work in a portfolio for a future employer to see will help. I hope to incorporate some of the Agile principles into my future work such as the Quality of code and technical excellence. These principles will ensure coding quality and enable proper professional organization of coding during development of any products building process.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member would be to be respectful, kind, and receptive of other teammates ideas and opinions. Just because your used to doing something one way doesn't mean theres not another way of doing something. Having the eagerness to learn new abilities and being receptive to new skills and abilities. The willingness to continue learning. These are just a few things that would make me a good team member.
